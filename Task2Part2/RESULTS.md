## Task 2: "Modelling and Optimization using OpenDSE"

### Observations of Exercise 2.2

* The cheapest found solution will use the minimum amount of resources possible (of course) - in this case the camera and the router.
* Local resources seem to be cheaper than cloud resources, due to one-time payment.
* The most expensive / best performing solution will exclusively work on cpTwoLarge (except for video recording which is done on the smart camera).
* The makespan of the cheapest solution is over 20x the makespan of the most expensive / best performing solution.
